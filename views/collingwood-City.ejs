        <p class="lead">

            Collingwood, Ontario was incorporated as a town in 1858, nine years before Confederation and was named after Admiral
            Lord Cuthbert Collingwood, Lord Nelson's second in command at the Battle of Trafalgar, who assumed command of the
            British fleet after Nelson's death.
            
            The Town of Collingwood is an exceptional community and a perfect destination for outdoor adventure and recreation - a
            fabulous winter and summer wonderland. The town has many shops, local business, places of interest and attractions for
            everyone in the family.
            
            Collingwood has focused on establishing itself as a four-season tourist area and has become the major recreation area
            for the southern part of the province.
